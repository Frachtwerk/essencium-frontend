# Runtime Config

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  Unfortunately, this feature does not work on Vercel deployments since we are
  not able to write to the file system which is required for the runtime config
  file.
</Callout>

Essencium provides the ability to pass a runtime config to your instance beside a build config. This feature shines when having i.e. multiple
environments like `development`, `staging`, `production` and you want to have different configurations for each environment without the need to rebuild
the application.

## How it works

Essencium utilises the [`instrumentation.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation#importing-runtime-specific-code) function that is invoked when starting the Next.js server. This function is responsible for
population the `runtimeConfig.js` file based on the given environment variables inside the `.env` file. It is then read by the application at different places. You can consider it as glue between the `.env` file and the application.

## Adding a new environment variable

1. Adding the new environment variable to the `.env` file
2. Adding the new environment variable to the `instrumentation.ts` file under `REPLACEMENTS` object and the corresponding scope (`required` or `optional`)
3. Adding the new environment variable to the `runtimeConfig.ts` file under the corresponding scope (`required` or `optional`)

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  When adding a new environment variable inside the `required` scope, the
  application will fail to start if the variable is not provided via the `.env`
  file.
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  Do not modifiy the values inside the `runtimeConfig.js` file directly. The
  values are populated by the `instrumentation.ts` file automatically.
</Callout>
