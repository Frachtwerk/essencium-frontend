# Commits

[`Commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) makes sure you are following the rules of
[`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

Schema: `<type>(<scope?>): <message>`

In combination with[`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) we can use Git hooks like `pre-commit` and
`commit-msg` to lint the commit and its message.

## `pre-commit` hook

To ensure a consistent code style, the `pre-commit` hook runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). To get more details about
the rules, visit [Codestyle and Linting](/devguide/codestyle-and-linting#eslint-configuration) in our docs. It also runs
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (in write-mode) and applies [certain rules](/devguide/codestyle-and-linting#rules). At
last, it sorts all `package.json` files via [`sort-package-json`](https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json).

## `commit-msg` hook

If the commit message doesnâ€™t follow the convention of conventional-commits, commitlint will error out and husky gives
you an idea of what is wrong.
