# Dependencies

For maintaing the Essencium project it is important to understand how to manage dependencies and their updates. This will help ensure that the project remains stable & secure. Here are some specific things to keep in mind when managing dependencies in Essencium.

## Installing & uninstalling Dependencies

When installing dependencies in Essencium, make sure to place them in the appropriate location based on the specific package structure of the project. See [package responsibilities](/devguide/packageResponsibilities).

They can be installed via `pnpm --filter @frachtwerk/essencium-<package> add <dependency>`.

It is important to note that some dependencies may need to be set under `peerDependencies` in the `lib` package, whenever they are required for components within `lib` to work. This ensures that the consuming project can provide the required dependencies at runtime.

It is also important to use fixed version numbers for dependencies to ensure consistency across packages and avoid compatibility issues that can lead to breaking changes.

Uninstalling a dependency can be done via `pnpm --filter @frachtwerk/essencium-<package> remove <dependency>`.

## Updating dependencies

Essencium uses [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) to automate the process of updating dependencies. A pull request for each dependency update will be created automatically.

Dependencies should be updated regularly to keep Essencium up-to-date with the latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Be careful to evaluate the impact of each update before merging it into the project as it may introduce breaking changes. For this, the changelog of the dependency should be checked.
