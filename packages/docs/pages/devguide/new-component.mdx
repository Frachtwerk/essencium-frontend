## Location and structure 📝

The files and folder structure follows the
[tightly-coupled architecture](https://nordicapis.com/the-difference-between-tight-coupling-and-loose-coupling/) and
underlies the [Next.js file-system router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages). That means that a file and code should live
as close as possible to its context. In the image below you can see we've a header component that is located under
`src/components`. It does have other components it uses. Because they're specific to it, they live in the
`header/components` folder and follow the same architecture. We don't place components beside the page (inside the
`pages` folder) because they're treated as routes then.

But to maintain a clean strucutre, we construct the same folder structure that fits to the structure of the page.

## Details

### General

- the component is located in:
  - the `components` folder
  - a folder that is named after the page folder it belongs to i.e. `components/users/UserForm.tsx`
- the file is named after the component and written in `PascalCase`

### Specific

- use functional components instead of class components

```tsx
// ❌
class NewComponent extends PureComponent { ... }

// ✅
function NewComponent(...) { ... }
```

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Functional components are easier to read and write. They're also more performant than class components. Additionally, we
  can make use of React Hooks.
</details>

---

- import types with `import type { ... } from ...` syntax

```typescript
// ❌
import { NewType } from ...

// ✅
import type { NewType } from ...
```

---

- check size of imports (i.e. with VSCode plugin
  [import costs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)) and reduce where possible
  (green is fine, red should be reviewed)

![Import Cost Valid](/images/import-cost-green.png)

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  It helps reducing the bundle size of your JavaScript code. The smaller the bundle size, the faster the page loads.
</details>

---

- use function declaration syntax instead of arrow function syntax.

```tsx
// ❌
const NewComponent = (...) => { ... }

// ✅
function NewComponent(...) { ... }
```

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  It's easier to read and identify a piece of code as function.
</details>

---

- export the functional component as default export (`export default MyComponent`) and at the bottom of the file


```tsx
// ❌
export function NewComponent(...) { ... }

// ✅
function NewComponent(...) { ... }
...
export default function NewComponent
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

Next.js needs a React component to be exported via `export default`.

</details>

---

- type the component's props with a TypeScript `type` and destructure them where possible.

```tsx
// ❌
function NewComponent(cmpProps: { username: string; age: number; }) { ... }

// ❌
function NewComponent({ username, age }: { username: string; age: number; }) { ... }

// ✅
type Props = {
  username: string
  age: number
}

// NewComponent.tsx
function NewComponent({ username, age }: Props) { ... }
```

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Reducec the amount of code and increases the readability.
</details>

---

- specify the return type of a component.

```tsx
// ❌
function NewComponent(...) { ... }

// ✅
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element { ... }
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

By specifying the concret return type, TypeScript will give you an error if you accidentally return a wrong type.
Additionally, it increases the consistency of always specifying the return type of functions throughout the codebase and
provides a better readability if you can directly recognize what a function returns.

</details>

---

- declare types specific to a file inside the file at the top (like `type Props`)

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Here we apply the [tightly-coupled architecture](https://nordicapis.com/the-difference-between-tight-coupling-and-loose-coupling/).
</details>

---

- logic that belongs together should live as close together as possible and they should be separated through a blank
  line.

```tsx
// ❌
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const [toggleColorTheme, setToggleColorTheme] = useState('light')
  const { t } = useTranslation()
  function onToggleColorTheme(): void {
    ...
    setToggleColorTheme('dark')
    ...
  }
}

// ✅
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [toggleColorTheme, setToggleColorTheme] = useState('light')

  function onToggleColorTheme(): void {
    ...
    setToggleColorTheme('dark')
    ...
  }
}
```

---

- Separate JSX elements with a blank line if they have the same indentation.

```tsx
// ❌
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Foo</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bar</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

// ✅
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Foo</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Bar</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

- all texts are replaced with a corresponding `i18n` variable

```tsx
// ❌
<h3>Login</h3>

// ✅
<h3>{t('login.title')}</h3>
```

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  To prevent hard coded strings inside the code and have only one source-of-truth for all your translations.
</details>

---

- avoid `any` where possible

```tsx
// ❌
function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<any>({ name: '', email: '' })
}

// ✅
type User = {
  name: string
  email: string
}

function NewComponent(...): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({ name: '', email: '' })
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  By telling TypeScript that a variable or function is of type `any` you disable TypeScript for it and don't get any type-safety
  anymore. Some typing is hard, we all know that, but at least ask for help and don't go the simple and insecure way.
</details>

---

- treat server requests as sensible

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Double-check if you make unnecessary or too many server requests caused by a suboptimal implementation. It could led to
  a bad performance and UX.
</details>

---

- provide feedback for every write, delete, update operation

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>A good UX consists of proper user feedback i.e. notifications. That gives the user confidence
  that his action was successful or has failed.
</details>

---

- use proper code formatting via Prettier & linting via ESLint

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Tools like Prettier (semantic) and ESLint (syntax) ensure a consistent codebase and keep readability on a high level.
</details>

---

- check console (browser and terminal) for any errors or warnings

<details>
  <summary>Why?</summary>
  Even though your implementation is fine, a warning or even an error can occur. Sometimes they're not reflected in the UI
  but in the console.
</details>

## Example

```tsx
// NewComponent.tsx
import { User } from 'your-types-package'

type Props = {
  onSave: () => void
}

export function NewComponent({onSave}: Props): JSX.Element {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  const [user, setUser] = useState<User>({ name: '', email: '' })


  const [toggleColorTheme, setToggleColorTheme] = useState('light')

  function onToggleColorTheme(): void {
    ...
    setToggleColorTheme('dark')
    ...
    onSave()
  }

    return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>{t('newComponent.title')}</h2>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>{name}</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

```
