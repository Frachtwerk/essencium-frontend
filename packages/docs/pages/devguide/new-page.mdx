# New page

To create a new page, go into the `app` folder. Inside of `/[locale]/(main)` you can find the main layout pages and create a new folder called like the path of the URL since we use
[Next.js file-system router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) i.e. `users`. Inside this folder, create a file called
`page.tsx` which is the server-side entrypoint for your route and where you can perform server.side actions. 
After you created the `page.tsx` file, create another file called `YourNewView.tsx` which is consumed by the `page.tsx file` and contains the actual component that will be rendered on the page. This way you can separate the server-side logic from the client-side logic if needed.

You can create further sub-pages by creating a new folder on the level of the `page.tsx`. For example, if you want to
create a new sub-page under `/users`, you can create a folder called `add` and create new files called `page.tsx` and `AddUserView.tsx`
inside it. This will create a new route `/users/add`. More details can be found inside the
[Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing). If the folder name contains more than one word, use `-` to separate them, i.e. `general-settings` in order to build up a consistent folder structure that is close the the one inside the `app` directory.
