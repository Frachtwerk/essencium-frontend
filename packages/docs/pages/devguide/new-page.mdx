# New page

To create a new page, go into the `pages` folder and create a new folder called like the path of the URL since we use
[Next.js file-system router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) i.e. `users`. Inside this folder, create a file called
`index.tsx` which is the entrypoint for your route.

You can create further sub-pages by creating a new folder on the level of the `index.tsx`. For example, if you want to
create a new sub-page under `/users`, you can create a folder called `add` and create another file called `index.tsx`
inside it. This will create a new route `/users/add`. More details can be inside the
[Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs).
