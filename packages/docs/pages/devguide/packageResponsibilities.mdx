# Package responsibilities

This page should answer the question: _Which implementation belongs into which package of the monorepo?_
Currently, we have the following packages:

- `app`
- `docs`
- `lib`
- `translations`

The challenge is to maintain separation of concerns for each package. The following sections list the responsibilities of each package.

## `app`

- the main application that consumes the `lib` package
- React views that import components from `lib`
- API implementation
- application state
- routing
- error logging

## `docs`

- documentation for the whole Essencium project
- getting started
- devguide
- styleguide
- changelog

## `lib`

- single React components with their types
- specific hooks

## `translations`

- translations for every langauge in a `.json` file (i.e. `en.json`)
- instanciation of i18n
