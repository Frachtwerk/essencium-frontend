# Package responsibilities

This page should answer the question: _Which implementation belongs into which package of the monorepo?_
Currently, we have the following packages:

- `app`
- `docs`
- `lib`
- `types`

The challenge is to maintain separation of concerns for each package. The following sections list the responsibilities of each package.

## `app`

- the main application that consumes the `lib` & `types` package
- Next.js pages that import components from `lib`
- API implementation
- application state
- routing (via [Next.js pages router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages))
- error logging (via [Sentry](https://sentry.io/))
- E2E tests (via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/))

## `docs` (this)

- documentation for the whole Essencium project
- getting started
- architecture
- development guide
- style guide

## `lib`

- single Next.js components
- specific hooks
- specific utility functions

## `types`

- shared types ('shared' means types that are used in `app` and `lib` together)
- zod schemas
