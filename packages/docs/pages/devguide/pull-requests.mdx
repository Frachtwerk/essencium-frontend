### Pull Requests

To ensure consistency, a template in the Essencium frontend repo is provided to use when opening a PR for Essencium.

The person who worked on the pull request should always set the appropriate labels as well as marking themselves as
assignee.

### Review Workflow

At least one person should be assigned as a reviewer. The reviewer should then start the code review as soon as
possible, ideally within 24 hours. If the reviewer doesn't have the capacity for the review at the moment, they should
assign another reviewer.

If a reviewer decides it would be beneficial to have someone else to take a second look at the PR they can also assign
someone else as reviewer after them.

When a PR is approved it is the responsibility of the person who created the pull request to merge the changes.

### Scope Changes

If the scope of the Pull Request differs from the original issues, e.g. some functionality is still missing or blocked,
new issues should be created for these missing parts and linked in the description of the PR.
