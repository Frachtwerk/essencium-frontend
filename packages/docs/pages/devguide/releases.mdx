# Releases

## CI/CD

Releases are managed by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and inside the CI/CD pipeline.
Release-please recognizes changes and parses the commit messages (via
[`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)) to determine the next version. Also, it generates a
changelog for each package. A new Git tag is created, and the release is published to the `npm` registry (`lib` and
`types` packages).

## Manual Build

A build can be created by executing the command `pnpm build`. Behind this command, `pnpm --stream -r build` takes control
and builds all packages inside of the monorepo as well as the Next.js application which is built statically. All
TypeScript files get transpiled to JavaScript files, and afterwards, these files get bundled with
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for production. A new folder `dist` or `.next` (for the `app` package) is
created holding the build artifacts that can be distributed.
