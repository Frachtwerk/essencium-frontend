### Prerequisites

The repository requires Node version 20, which is in [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule). It can be easily installed via the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) following
the setup in the `README.md`. Additionally, we support the tool manager [Volta](https://volta.sh/). Volta makes sure
that your environment (like the Node version, `pnpm` version etc.) is always the same for that specific repository. By
navigating to the repository folder on your machine, Volta automatically switches to the versions of the tools specified
in the `package.json` files.

Besides, you need the package manager [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), which can be installed with
`npm install --global pnpm` (will be installed globally). `pnpm` is much faster than `npm` and handles the
`node_modules` folder in a much more efficient way. It is also possible to use `npm` or `yarn` instead of `pnpm`. You
need to convert the lockfile accordingly.

### Setup

Before the setup is complete, you need to run `pnpm setup-env` inside the root. The script will automatically install
all dependencies and enables [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) hooks for `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` linting.
More about the hooks can be read [here](/devguide/commits).
