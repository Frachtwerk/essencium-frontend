import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

### Prerequisites

The repository requires Node version 18, which is in [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) until **30.04.2025**. It can
be easily installed via the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) following the setup in the `README.md`.
Additionally, we support the tool manager [Volta](https://volta.sh/). Volta makes sure that your environment (like the Node version, `pnpm`
version etc.) is always the same for that specific repository. By navigating to the repository folder on your machine, Volta automatically
switches to the versions of the tools specified in the `package.json` files.

Besides, you need the package manager [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), which can be installed with `npm install --global pnpm` (will be installed
globally). `pnpm` is much faster than `npm` and handles the `node_modules` folder in a much more efficient way. It is also possible to use
`npm` or `yarn` instead of `pnpm`. You need to convert the lockfile accordingly.

### Setup

Before the setup is complete, you need to run `pnpm setup-env` inside the root. The script will automatically install all dependencies and
enables [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) hooks for `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` linting.

#### `pre-commit` hook

  If the hook fails, the commit will be aborted.
</Callout>

To ensure a consistent code style, the `pre-commit` hook runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

To get more details about the rules, visit [Codestyle and Linting](/devguide/codestyle-and-linting#eslint-configuration) in our docs.

It also runs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (in write-mode) and applies [certain rules](/devguide/codestyle-and-linting#rules).

At last, it sorts all `package.json` files via [`sort-package-json`](https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json).
