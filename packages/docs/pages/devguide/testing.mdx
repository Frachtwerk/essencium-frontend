# Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing our components and functions. For E2E tests, we use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).

  For testing translations, we agreed on validating the translation key **for
  component tests** instead of the resolved value. For E2E tests, we validate
  the resolved value in the UI.

## Component tests

For every new component, it's required to write a corresponding component test, that checks the output dependent on the given inputs like props, state, etc.

## Unit tests

For i.e. utility functions, it's required to write a corresponding unit test that checks the output dependent on the given inputs of that function.

## E2E tests

For new workflows, it's required to simulate them by implementing an E2E test. For example, the login and logout workflow or the workflow for creating, editing and deleting a user.
