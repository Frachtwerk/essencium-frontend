# Types

The monorepo contains a package called `types` which has clear rules which types are included there. Basically, types
should live and be exported in the corresponding file where it is initially created.

An example is a type called `Props` that includes some prop types of a component. Initially, we assume the type is only
used in this file so it's declared there.

```tsx
// imported from '@frachtwerk/essencium-types' package because 'UserInput' is used in multiple packages
import { UserInput } from '@frachtwerk/essencium-types'

// exported to be used in multiple files but not in other packages
export type Avatar = {
    url: string
    alt: number
}

// only used in this file
type Props = {
    name: string
    age: number
}

function Profile(props: Props): JSX.Element { ... }
```

Sometimes we have a case, where a type is used across multiple packages in the monorepo. This is exactly why the `types`
package exists. **It holds all types that are used by more than one package.**
