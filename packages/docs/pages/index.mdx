### What is Essencium?

A **scalable**, **easy-to-maintain** and **adaptable** boilerplate based on Next.js.

### Background

The goal of Essencium is effortlessly build a scalable, easy-to-maintain and adaptable frontend. Projects based on
Essencium should receive updates in the simplest way. Therefore, the Essencium library is built as an `npm`-package that
can be installed via a package manager like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`. As a consequence, new changes made on the Essencium
library can be rolled-out as a new version and Essencium-based projects can easily update the dependency without copy
and pasting the code manually.

### Monorepository

We chose to use a monorepo architecture with the library, types, docs and the application as packages. That allows to
easily develop the library, utilizing Vite and inspect the source code changes of the library via HMR inside the browser
as if it was a single codebase. As a build tool we use `nx`. That allows us to run certain commands (like `build` or
`test`) for all packages, with keeping the correct dependency order in mind. Additionally, `nx` caches jobs, that means
if source files of a dependency have not been changed, the needed files get fetched from the cache instead of being
re-built.
