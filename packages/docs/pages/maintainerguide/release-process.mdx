# Release Process

We use [`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) as automation tool for creating new versions and corresponding changelogs. It uses [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) parsing for doing so.
Release Please creates a new pull request called `chore: release main` if a merged commit contains a conventional commit message. This PR will contain the new version number and the changelog for each changed package of the monorepo.
Usually, we need to update the `MIGRAION.md` file inside a pull request (see [Migration Guide](/migrationguide)) and as the migration guide says, we need to adjust the file inside the release pull request:

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  Since the version and date under which the changes are made are not known at
  the time of the feature PR, those need to be set when
  [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) creates the
  release PR. That means editing the `MIGRATION.md` file during the review of
  the release PR. Instead of the version you can use `x.y.z` and `DD.MM.YYYY` as
  a placeholder.
</Callout>

That means updating and commiting the new changes to the release branch, review the whole pull request and merge it afterwards.

Release Please will then create new tags for each new version and a new release in GitHub. Furthermore, the packages `lib` and `types` will be published to the `npm` registry.

Dependent projects can then be updated according to the migration guide.
