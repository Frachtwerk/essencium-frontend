# Migration Guide

Sometimes, a new version of a package will introduce changes which _could be breaking_. We made it part of the development process to document these changes inside the `MIGRATION.md` file of the `app` package. This file will contain a list of changes and how to migrate from the old version to the new version.
Since developers eventually must manually update the own codebase, we are particularly careful to document these changes and make it as easy as possible to migrate.

The `MIGRATION.md` file follows this schema:

````markdown copy
# Migrations

## x.y.z (DD.MM.YYYY)

### `path/to/file_1.extension`

- logic that needs to be changed is described here

```diff
+ added line
- removed line
```
````

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  Since the version under which the changes are made is not known at the time of
  the PR, the version needs to be set when
  [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) creates the
  release PR. That means editing the `MIGRATION.md` file during the review of
  the release PR. Instead of the version you can use `x.y.z` as a placeholder.
