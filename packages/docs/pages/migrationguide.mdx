# Migration Guide

Sometimes, a new version of a package will introduce changes which _could be breaking_. We made it part of the development process to document these changes inside the `MIGRATION.md` file of the `app` package. This file will contain a list of changes and how to migrate from the old to the new version.
Since developers eventually must manually update their own codebase, we are particularly careful to document these changes and make it as easy as possible to migrate.

The `MIGRATION.md` file follows this schema:

```markdown copy
## [x.y.z (DD.MM.YYYY)](#link-to-diff-between-this-and-previous-version)

### `path/to/file_1.extension`

- logic that needs to be changed is described here
```

First comes the version and date of the release, followed by a link to the diff between this and the previous version. Then, a list of changes is documented, each with a link to the file that needs to be changed and a concise description of the change.

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type="warning">
  Since the version and date under which the changes are made are not known at
  the time of the PR, those need to be set when
  [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) creates the
  release PR. That means editing the `MIGRATION.md` file during the review of
  the release PR. Instead of the version you can use `x.y.z` and `DD.MM.YYYY` as
  a placeholder.
