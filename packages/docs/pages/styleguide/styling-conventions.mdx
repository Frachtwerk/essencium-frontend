# Styling conventions

To maintain consistency across the codebase, we adhere to the following conventions.

## Component Styles

This is the styling hierarchy for component styles, staying as close to native Mantine functionality as possible.

[CSS modules](https://mantine.dev/styles/css-modules/) > [Component Style Props](https://mantine.dev/styles/style-props/) > [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/)

### Naming of CSS classes

We follow the [BEM conventions](https://getbem.com/introduction/) to ensure a consistent approach when naming the classes.

## Colors

Colors should never be hardcoded anywhere in the codebase except for the Mantine theme config. Only colors from the
[Mantine Color palette](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) or self-defined color palettes should be used.

## Margin & Padding

Default is `md`, but the spacing should be set according to the needs of the specific situation. Only thing important to
keep in mind is to stick to the Mantine sizing scale `xs` --> `xl` to ensure consistent spacing values.

## Radius

Default is `sm`.

## Shadow

Default is `sm`, it provides a good compromise between flat design and giving some depth to the elements.

## Font Size

Default is `md`.

## Font Weight

Default is `400`/`normal`

## Button Styles

Primary Buttons should be of the `filled` variant.

Secondary Buttons should be of the `light` variant.

Other buttons that need to be emphasized differently should be of the `subtle` variant.
